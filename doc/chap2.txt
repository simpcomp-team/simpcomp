  [33X[0;0YA  polytopal  complex  which  entirely  consists  of  simplices  is called a
  [13Xsimplicial  complex[113X  (for  this it actually suffices that the facets (i. e.,
  the  faces  that  are  not  included  in any other face of the complex) of a

  [33X[0;0YEvery  [22Xd[122X-simplex  has  an [13Xunderlying set[113X in [22XE^d[122X, as the set of all points of

  [13Xtriangulation of [22X|C|[122X[113X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne can also go the other way and assign an abstract simplicial complex to a
  geometrical  one  by  identifying  each  simplex  with  its vertex set. This
  obviously defines a set of sets with a natural partial ordering given by the
  inclusion (a socalled [13Xposet[113X).[133X

  of  [22Xv[122X  in  [22XC[122X[113X  and  is denoted by star[22X_C(v)[122X. The subcomplex of star[22X_C(v)[122X that
  contains  all  faces  not  containing [22Xv[122X is called [13Xlink of [22Xv[122X in [22XC[122X[113X, written as

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  every  combinatorial  manifold  is  a triangulated manifold. The
  opposite is wrong: for example, there exists a triangulation of the [22X5[122X-sphere
  that is not combinatorial, the so called [13XEdward's sphere[113X, see [BL00].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  combinatorial  manifold  carries  an  induced  PL-structure  and  can  be
  understood  in terms of an abstract simplicial complex. If the complex has [22Xd[122X

  thus, into [22XE^d-1[122X. In general, there is no canonical embedding into any lower
  dimensional  space.  However, combinatorial methods allow to examine a given

  independently from vertex coordinates.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe concept of [13Xnormal surfaces[113X is originally due to Kneser [Kne29] and Haken
  [Hak61]:  A  surface [22XS[122X, properly embedded into a [22X3[122X-manifold [22XM[122X, is said to be
  [13Xnormal[113X,  if  it  respects  a  given cell decomposition of [22XM[122X in the following
  sense: It does not intersect any vertex nor touch any [22X3[122X-cell of the manifold
  and  does  not  intersect with any [22X2[122X-cell in a circle or an arc starting and
  ending  in a point of the same edge. Here we will look at normal surfaces in
  the  case that [22XM[122X is given as a combinatorial [22X3[122X-manifold and we will call the
  corresponding  objects  [13Xdiscrete normal surfaces[113X. In order to do this let us

  [33X[0;0YIn  the  field  of  PL-topology  KÃ¼hnel  developed  what  one  might  call a
  polyhedral  Morse  theory (compare [K\t95], not to be confused with Forman's
  discrete Morse theory for cell complexes which is decribed in Section [14X2.6[114X):[133X
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XM[122X  be a combinatorial [22Xd[122X-manifold. A function [22Xf:M -> R[122X is called [13Xregular
  simplexwise  linear (rsl)[113X if [22Xf(v) â‰  f(w)[122X for any two vertices [22Xw â‰  v[122X and if [22Xf[122X
  is linear when restricted to an arbitrary simplex of the triangulation.[133X
  [33X[0;0YA  vertex  [22Xx âˆˆ M[122X is said to be [13Xcritical[113X for an rsl-function [22Xf:M -> R[122X, if [22XH_â‹†
  (M_x , M_x backslash { x } , F) â‰  0[122X where [22XM_x := { y âˆˆ M | f(y) â‰¤ f(x) }[122X and
  [22XF[122X is a field.[133X
  [33X[0;0YIt  follows that no point of [22XM[122X can be critical except possibly the vertices.
  In arbitrary dimensions we define:[133X
  [33X[0;0Y[12XDefinition[112X (Slicing, [Spr11b])[133X
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XM[122X  be  a  combinatorial  pseudomanifold  of dimension [22Xd[122X and [22Xf:M -> R[122X an
  rsl-function.  Then we call the pre-image [22Xf^-1 (Î±)[122X a [13Xslicing[113X of [22XM[122X whenever [22XÎ±
  â‰  f(v)[122X for any vertex [22Xv âˆˆ M[122X.[133X
  [33X[0;0YBy construction, a slicing is a polytopal [22X(d-1)[122X-manifold and for any ordered
  pair  [22XÎ±  â‰¤  Î²[122X  we  have [22Xf^-1 (Î±) â‰… f^-1 (Î²)[122X whenever [22Xf^-1([Î±,Î²])[122X contains no
  vertex of [22XM[122X. In particular, a slicing [22XS[122X of a closed combinatorial [22X3[122X-manifold
  [22XM[122X is a discrete normal surface: It follows from the simplexwise linearity of
  [22Xf[122X  that  the  intersection of the pre-image with any tetrahedron of [22XM[122X either
  forms  a  single  triangle  or  a  single quadrilateral. In addition, if two
  facets  of  [22XS[122X  lie  in adjacent tetrahedra they either are disjoint or glued
  together  along  the  intersection  line  of  the  pre-image  and the common
  triangle.[133X
  [33X[0;0YAny  partition  of  the  set  of  vertices  [22XV  =  V_1  dotâˆª V_2[122X of [22XM[122X already
  determines a slicing: Just define an rsl-function [22Xf: M -> R[122X with [22Xf(v) â‰¤ f(w)[122X
  for  all  [22Xv  âˆˆ  V_1[122X  and  [22Xw  âˆˆ  V_2[122X and look at a suitable pre-image. In the
  following  we  will  write [22XS_(V_1,V_2)[122X for the slicing defined by the vertex
  partition [22XV = V_1 dotâˆª V_2[122X.[133X
  [33X[0;0YEvery  vertex  of  a  slicing  is  given  as  an  intersection  point of the
  corresponding  pre-image with an edge [22XâŸ¨ u,w âŸ©[122X of the combinatorial manifold.
  Since  there  is  at  most  one such intersection point per edge, we usually
  label  this  vertex  of  the  slicing  according  to  the  vertices  of  the
  corresponding edge, that is [22Xbinomuw[122X with [22Xu âˆˆ V_1[122X and [22Xw âˆˆ V_2[122X.[133X
  [33X[0;0YEvery  slicing  decomposes  the surrounding combinatorial manifold [22XM[122X into at
  least  [22X2[122X  pieces  (an  upper part [22XM^+[122X and a lower part [22XM^-[122X). This is not the
  case  for  discrete  normal  surfaces (see [14X2.4[114X) in general. However, we will
  focus  on  the  case where discrete normal surfaces are slicings and we will
  apply the above notation for both types of objects.[133X
  [33X[0;0YSince  every combinatorial pseudomanifold [22XM[122X has a finite number of vertices,
  there  exist  only  a  finite number of slicings of [22XM[122X. Hence, if [22Xf[122X is chosen
  carefully,  the  induced  slicings  admit  a useful visualization of [22XM[122X, c.f.

  [33X[0;0YTightness is a notion developed in the field of differential geometry as the
  equality  of the (normalized) [13Xtotal absolute curvature[113X of a submanifold with
  the  lower  bound  [13Xsum  of  the  Betti numbers[113X [Kui84], [BK97]. It was first

  extended  to  the  polyhedral  case  by Banchoff [Ban65], Kuiper [Kui84] and
  KÃ¼hnel  [K\t95].  From  a  geometrical  point  of  view,  tightness  can  be
  understood  as  a generalization of the concept of convexity that applies to
  objects  other  than topological balls and their boundary manifolds since it
  roughly  means  that  an  embedding  of  a  submanifold  is  ``as  convex as

  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XF[122X  be  a field. A combinatorial manifold [22XK[122X on [22Xn[122X vertices is called [13X([22Xk[122X-)
  tight  w.r.t.  [22XF[122X[113X  if  its  canonical  embedding [22XKâŠ‚ âˆ†^n-1âŠ‚ E^n-1[122X is ([22Xk[122X-)tight
  w.r.t. [22XF[122X, where [22Xâˆ†^n-1[122X denotes the [22X(n-1)[122X-dimensional simplex.[133X
  [33X[0;0YIn  dimension  [22Xd=2[122X the following are equivalent for a triangulated surface [22XS[122X
  on  [22Xn[122X  vertices: (i) [22XS[122X has a complete edge graph [22XK_n[122X, (ii) [22XS[122X appears as a so
  called  [13Xregular case[113X in Heawood's Map Color Theorem [Rin74], compare [K\t95]
  and  (iii)  the  induced  piecewise  linear  embedding  of  [22XS[122X into Euclidean
  [22X(n-1)[122X-space has the two-piece property [Ban74], and it is tight [K\t95].[133X
  [33X[0;0YKÃ¼hnel   investigated  the  tightness  of  combinatorial  triangulations  of
  manifolds also in higher dimensions and codimensions, see [K\t94]. It turned
  out  that  the tightness of a combinatorial triangulation is closely related
  to  the  concept of [13XHamiltonicity[113X of a polyhedral complexes (see [K\t95]): A
  subcomplex [22XA[122X of a polyhedral complex [22XK[122X is called [13X[22Xk[122X-Hamiltonian[113X if [22XA[122X contains
  the  full [22Xk[122X-dimensional skeleton of [22XK[122X (not to be confused with the notion of
  a  [22Xk[122X-Hamiltonian  graph). This generalization of the notion of a Hamiltonian
  circuit  in  a  graph  seems  to  be  due to C.Schulz [Sch94]. A Hamiltonian
  circuit  then  becomes  a  special  case  of a [22X0[122X-Hamiltonian subcomplex of a
  [22X1[122X-dimensional graph or of a higher-dimensional complex.[133X
  [33X[0;0YA  triangulated  [22X2k[122X-manifold  that  is  a  [22Xk[122X-Hamiltonian  subcomplex  of the
  boundary complex of some higher dimensional simplex is a tight triangulation
  as   KÃ¼hnel   [K\t95]   showed.   Such   a   triangulation  is  also  called
  [13X[22X(k+1)[122X-neighborly  triangulation[113X  since  any  [22Xk+1[122X vertices in a [22Xk[122X-dimensional
  simplex  are  common neighbors. Moreover, [22X(k+1)[122X-neighborly triangulations of
  [22X2k[122X-manifolds  are  also referred to as [13Xsuper-neighborly[113X triangulations -- in
  analogy  with neighborly polytopes the boundary complex of a [22X(2k+1)[122X-polytope
  can  be  at  most  [22Xk[122X-neighborly  unless  it  is  a simplex. Notice here that
  combinatorial  [22X2k[122X-manifolds  can  go  beyond  [22Xk[122X-neighborliness, depending on
  their topology.[133X
  [33X[0;0YWhereas  in the [22X2[122X-dimensional case all tight triangulations of surfaces were
  classified  by  Ringel  and  Jungerman  and Ringel, in dimensions [22Xdâ‰¥ 3[122X there
  exist  only  a  finite number of known examples of tight triangulations (see
  [KL99]  for  a  census)  apart  from  the  trivial case of the boundary of a
  simplex  and an infinite series of triangulations of sphere bundles over the
  circle due to KÃ¼hnel [K\t95], [K\t86].[133X
  
  
  [1X2.8 [33X[0;0YSimplicial blowups[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xblowing up process[113X or [13XHopf [22XÏƒ[122X-process[113X can be described as the resolution
  of  nodes or ordinary double points of a complex algebraic variety. This was
  described  by  H.~Hopf  in  [Hop51],  compare  [Hir53] and [Hau00]. From the
  topological  point of view the process consists of cutting out some subspace
  and  gluing  in some other subspace. In complex algebraic geometry one point
  is  replaced  by the projective line [22XCP^1 â‰… S^2[122X of all complex lines through
  that  point. This is often called [13Xblowing up[113X of the point or just [13Xblowup[113X. In
  general  the process can be applied to non-singular 4-manifolds and yields a
  transformation  of  a manifold [13XM[113X to [22XM # (+CP^2)[122X or [22XM # (-CP^2)[122X, depending on
  the choice of an orientation. The same construction is possible for nodes or
  ordinary  double  points  (a  special  type  of singularities), and also the
  ambiguity  of  the orientation is the same for the blowup process of a node.
  Similarly it has been used in arbitrary even dimension by Spanier [Spa56] as
  a so-called [13Xdilatation process[113X.[133X
  [33X[0;0YA PL version of the blowing up process is the following: We cut out the star
  of  one of the singular vertices which is, in the case of an ordinary double
  point,  nothing  but  a  cone  over a triangulated [22XRP^3[122X. The boundary of the
  resulting   space  is  this  triangulated  [22XRP^3[122X.  Now  we  glue  back  in  a
  triangulated  version  [22XmathbfC[122X  of  a complex projective plane with a [22X4[122X-ball
  removed  where  antipodal  points of the boundary are identified. [22XmathbfC[122X is
  called  a  triangulated mapping cylinder and by construction its boundary is
  PL homeomorphic to [22XRP^3[122X.[133X
  [33X[0;0YFor  a  combinatorial version with concrete triangulations, however, we face
  the  problem  that these two triangulations are not isomorphic. This implies
  that  before  cutting out and gluing in we have to modify the triangulations
  by bistellar moves until they coincide:[133X

  isomorphic  with  the  particular  [22X11[122X-vertex  triangulation of [22XRP^3[122X which is

  Let  [22XÏˆ  :  operatornamelk(v)  â†’  âˆ‚mathbfC[122X  denote  such  an  isomorphism.  A

  [33X[0;0YThe  process is described in more detail in [SK11]. In particular it is used
