Expand documentation:
- tell people to copy HTML & PDF documentation into
  the doc/ dir in their gh-pages branch
- explain how to update things after making a release
- in general, try to make the instructions safe for
  people who are not git experts.

Add more info to default template?
E.g. links to github issue tracker, wiki, ...


* change current instruction to tell people to make a fresh clone into `gh-pages`
  subdirectory and use that.
