  shelling intersection was not checked for pureness.

  For complexes of dim > 2, the 2-skeleton is exported now.
- Added new series of triangulations of certain Hamiltonian subcomplexes
  of the cross polytope in arbitrary dimension: SCSeriesBid.

01/06/2011 - Version 1.5.0: Major update. Reworked most parts of package.
- Completely rewritten type system, simpcomp is now compliant to the
  standard GAP object format. Introduced new object type
  SCPolyhedralComplex, from which both SCSimplicialComplex and
  SCNormalSurface are derived.
- Changed naming of .-operator for simpcomp objects -- now there exist
  short and long versions of method names.
- SCFaces and operator [] for polyhedral complex are now synonyms for
  SCSkel.
- Vertex labels must now be elements with a total ordering.
- Changed behaviour of operator = for SCSimplicialComplex: complexes
  are now only equal if and only if they have the same facet lists
  in standard labelling 1..n (used to include combinatorial isomorphy).
- Fixed bug in SCRelabel... functions. As a side-effect, function
  SCSortComplex was deprecated and is now gone.
- Fixed serveral small bugs in the classification functions for
  transitive manifolds with the prefix SCs...  -- now all manifolds
  should be found.
- Heavily reworked SCsFromGroup...-functions, should be much faster now.
- Added and changed a lot of new functionality reagarding infinite
  series of triangulations, function prefix SCSeries...
- Changed file format to binary one. Note that SCSave/SCLoad now use
  the binary format. If you want to continue using XML, use
  SCSaveXML/SCLoadXML. The package falls back to old format where
  neccessary.
- Fixed bugs in SCDetermineTopologicalType and SCSpanningTree reported
  by Jack Schmidt (thank you!). In some cases, the spanning tree was
  not computed correctly. SCDetermineTopological did not work
  correctly with user libraries.
- SCIsInKd now only checks one link if the complex has a transitive
  automorphism group.
- Fixed polymake export/import SCExportPolymake/SCImportPolymake.
- Fixed small bug in SCAutmorphismGroupInternal.
- Changed the way the documentation is generated (using GAPDoc) --
  the examples should now always be up to date and in sync with the code.
- Changed package tests. Got rid of testshort.gap and testall.gap, the
  only function you need from now on is SCRunTest().
- Added interface to GAP package "homalg" by Mohamed Barakat -- the
  package can now be used for homology-related computations. In particular,
  simpcomp can now calculate homology groups with arbitrary coefficients
  using homalg.

17/08/2010 - Version 1.3.3: Minor bug-fix

  versions 1.3.1 and 1.3.2

26/05/2010 - Version 1.3.0: Major update. 
             New functions, updated library and bug fixes.
- simpcomp has learned to generate all triangulations with k-transitive
  automorphism groups given a prescribed dimension and vertex number. See the
  function prefix SCsFromGroup.
- Expanded the library to also contain pseudomanifolds -- the library now
  contains ca. 650 manifolds and ca. 7000 pseudomanifolds, it indexes the
  properties IsManifold and IsPM and supports them in property-based searches.
- SCExportLatexTable now uses SCFacets instead of SCFacetsEx and thus respects
  vertex labelings. Take care not to choose to wild labels though, these are not
  checked for latex compatibility during the export.
- Changed naming scheme of automorphism groups -- StructureDescription is only
  called if the group cannot be found in GAPs group libraries out of speed
  considerations.
- Fixed small error in SCIntFunc.ReadPermGroup resulting in an error when trying
  to load complexes with trivial automorphism groups

30/04/2010 - Version 1.2.73: Midsize update. simpcomp now has a mascot!
